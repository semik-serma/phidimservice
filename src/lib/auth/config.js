 * Centralized route -> roles table.
 *
 *  - MIDDLEWARE uses this for the fast, JWT-based first line of
 *    defence on every matched request (see src/middleware.js).
 *  - The guards (src/lib/auth/guards.js) perform the authoritative,
 *    database-backed check as a second line of defence.
 *
 * Keeping policies here means adding/removing a protected route is a
 * one-line change and the URL-typing bypass is closed in middleware.
