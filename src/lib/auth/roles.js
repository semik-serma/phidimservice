 * RBAC — CENTRAL ROLE DEFINITIONS (single source of truth)
 * ============================================================
 *
 * This module is intentionally PURE JavaScript with NO Next.js or
 * Node-only imports so it can be required from:
 *   - middleware (Edge runtime)
 *   - server components
 *   - route handlers / server actions
 *   - the (legacy) Express-style auth layer under src/server
 *
 * If a new role is ever added, it must be defined here FIRST,
 * then wired into: ROUTE_ACCESS_RULES (config.js), the User model
 * enum, and the dashboard redirects.
